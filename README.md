# IntelliSA

> An Intelligent Analyzer for IaC Security Smell Detection via Rule and Neural Inference

This is the research hub for **IntelliSA**, a system that combines static analysis with Large Language Models to reduce false positives in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) security scanning.

**Paper**: "IntelliSA: An Intelligent Analyzer for IaC Security Smell Detection via Rule and Neural Inference"

## Overview

**Problem**: Static analysis tools generate high false positive rates, causing alert fatigue and preventing widespread adoption.

**Solution**: IntelliSA uses rule-based detection combined with neural inference to distinguish true security vulnerabilities from false alarms while maintaining high recall.

**Target**: 9 security smell categories across Ansible, Chef, and Puppet.
